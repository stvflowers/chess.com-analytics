pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the advanced analysis** (recommended):
```bash
python advanced_game_analysis.py
```

3. **Customize the username** by editing the script:
```python
username = "your_chess_username_here"  # Change this line
```

## Customization Options

### Change the player to analyze:
```python
username = "gmmagnus"  # Or any Chess.com username
```

### Adjust number of games to analyze:
```python
analyze_user_games(username, 50)  # Analyze last 50 games instead of 30
```

### Focus on specific metrics:
- Edit the `analyze_user_games()` function to add custom analysis
- Modify the `classify_opening()` function to add more opening classifications
- Extend the statistics section to include additional metrics

## API Rate Limits

- Be respectful of Chess.com's API rate limits
- The scripts include proper User-Agent headers as required
- Add delays between requests if analyzing multiple players

## Troubleshooting

1. **No games found**: Some players may have private profiles or no recent games
2. **Missing accuracy data**: Chess.com doesn't provide accuracy for all game types
3. **API errors**: Check your internet connection and try again

## Next Steps

- **Add visualizations**: Use matplotlib or plotly to create charts
- **Database storage**: Store historical data for trend analysis
- **Compare multiple players**: Analyze head-to-head records
- **Opening repertoire analysis**: Deep dive into opening preferences
- **Performance by time control**: Separate analysis for different time formats

The `advanced_game_analysis.py` script provides the most comprehensive analysis and is the best starting point for serious chess data analysis.
